# Distance-estimation-Using-monocular-camera


# Introduction
This is the Keras Implementation of **DISNET** the research paper for the following is here
https://project.inria.fr/ppniv18/files/2018/10/paper22.pdf  

as for the data I've used KITTI Dataset for this.


As of now I'm getting very low accuracy of 0.22% which is extremly bad even though I've set the learning rate, loss function as per the paper, considering I've enough data for it to train, although the losses are as same as there in the paper, Still I'm working on it Once I solve it I'll update it here. If you can find the issue or where I'm going wrong let me know.
